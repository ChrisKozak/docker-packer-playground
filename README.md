========================

As a developer, I find it easier to get up and running with Ubuntu than CentOS.  However, my friends in Operations find it easier to keep CentOS stable and secure.  I'm exploring development within an Ubuntu docker container on a secure CentOS image in the hope that I can marry the benefits of each.
